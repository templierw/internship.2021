# Internship 2021

This internship, conducted at the [SYREL](https://g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr/en/research/syrel) of the G2ELab (Université Grenoble-Alpes), lasted from February to July 2021. It was part of a research project course of my first year as a graduate student in [MoSIG](https://mosig.imag.fr/ProgramEn/M1S2). My supervisors were [Vincent Debusschere](https://g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr/fr/le-laboratoire/debusschere-vincent) and Rémy Rigo-Mariani.

To validate the internship, a report (`templier_report_cor_ext.pdf`) was submitted and followed by a defense (slides included in `paper.tar.gz`).

The primary goal of this internship was to evaluate if artificial neural networks were able to handle the task of net load disaggregation on different cases. For more details about the scientific context and the cases, please refer to the first sections of the report.

The `lib/` directory contains adaptation to my problem of pre-existing deep learning frameworks (*PyTorch* and *GluonTS*). Much of the code is indebted to tutorials or books as I learned to use them while doing this internship. They are not error-proof and complete - but demonstrate my understanding of programming deep learning models, training and evaluating them. Nevertheless, most of the work was done using *Scikit-learn* (which I also learnt during this period) - but there is no library related to it.
